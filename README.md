# refine
rewrite ai agent
Prompt Generation: The agent starts by creating a diverse set of initial prompts designed to generate a specific type of text (e.g., ad copy, email subject lines).
Content Generation & Rewriting: These prompts are fed to a generative AI model to produce various versions of the copy. The agent then also rephrases or rewrites this initial output to create additional variations.
Automated Evaluation: Each piece of generated copy is automatically scored against a set of predefined metrics. These can include:
Performance Metrics: Predicted click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, engagement score.
Quality Metrics: Readability, brand voice consistency, sentiment analysis, and originality scores.
Technical Metrics: Scores like BLEU or Perplexity to measure fluency and coherence.
Prompt Selection & Optimization: The agent analyzes which initial prompts and rewriting strategies produced the highest-scoring copy. It then retains and prioritizes these "winning" prompts, often using them as a basis to generate new, even more refined prompts for the next cycle.
This entire process is a closed-loop feedback system that continuously learns and improves, ensuring the AI gets better at generating high-performing content over time.
